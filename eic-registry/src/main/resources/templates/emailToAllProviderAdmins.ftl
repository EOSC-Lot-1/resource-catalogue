Dear EOSC Service Provider,

On behalf of EOSC Future, we are planning a number of enhancements to the EOSC Platform (EOSC Resource Catalogue and EOSC Marketplace) which will be released in batches starting at the end of June 2022. As part of these enhancements, we will disable access to the EOSC Providers Dashboard on June 22 and restore access on June 27, 2022.  You will be notified by email when access is restored.

The planned enhancements will prepare the EOSC Platform to provide several new capabilities to users including:
Enabling the inclusion of services from other service catalogues, making the EOSC Marketplace more of a “one stop shop” for researchers looking for resources they need.
Enabling the inclusion of a wider range of data collections (“data sources”) as well as the research products they contain.
Improving users’ ability to find and use services from the EOSC Resource Catalogue.

These and other enhancements require converting your existing Provider and Resource records to the latest version (v4.00) of the EOSC Profiles.  The changes implemented under Profiles v4.00 are detailed here.  We will perform the conversion on your behalf, transferring your existing data to the new schema, and filling in default values in the case of new mandatory attributes.  Although not strictly required, we recommend that you defer any updates to EOSC Resources from now until the enhancements are available for general use.

After the conversion is complete, the EOSC Portal Onboarding Team will contact you if there are any issues that need your attention. You are encouraged to review your migrated records and validate and/or update them as needed.

None of these changes will negatively affect the way your information is presented in the Marketplace – and some of these changes will make it possible for you to more accurately describe your services to potential users and make them more likely to be found and used.

If you use the EOSC Resource Catalogue APIs to load or update your information in the EOSC Resource Catalogue, please contact helpdesk@eosc-portal.eu and mention this issue.  You will receive guidance to make sure your information will be properly handled during this process and to confirm the schedule for testing the new APIs and applying the required changes.

If you have any questions about this process, please contact helpdesk@eosc-portal.eu.

Best regards,

Mark Dietrich
On behalf of the EOSC Technical Coordination Board
